compliance with this License Agreement, LGE grants to You a limited, worldwide, revocable, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable right and license to access, download, install and
use a reasonable number of copies of the SDK on computers or other devices owned or controlled by You,
for the sole purpose of Your and, if applicable, any other Authorized Users’ development and test of
Applications.

2.2 Without limitation of any other provision contained herein, You will be liable for all failures of
any other Authorized Users to comply with the terms, conditions, requirements and limitations set
forth in this License Agreement.

2.3 This License Agreement is a license of the SDK and not an assignment. You acknowledge and agree
that, as between You and LGE, LGE owns the SDK, any Update or Upgrade thereto and all Intellectual
Property Rights therein. LGE reserves all rights not expressly granted to You hereunder.

2.4 You acknowledge and agree that an Application must satisfy LGE’s technical standards before it can
be tested on the relevant LGE product pursuant to LGE’s internal quality assessment process. LGE
reserves the right to reject any Application at its sole discretion. LGE’s testing of an Application
shall not be construed as LGE’s approval on the Application on any aspect. If a material change is
made to the Application, You must submit the revised version for LGE’s approval.

2.5 Except to the extent required by applicable law or third party licenses, neither You nor any other
Authorized User shall copy (except for back-up purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile,

does not entitle You to receive support, telephone assistance or enhancements or Updates or Upgrades
to the SDK from LGE.

2.6 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an OSS license, if any,
are governed solely by the terms of that OSS license and not this License Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, You shall ensure that Applications developed hereunder do not incorporate any OSS in a
manner which would cause any non-OSS portions of the SDK to be subject to any OSS licensing requirements.

2.7 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK may change without prior notice to You and that
future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with Applications developed on previous versions of
the SDK. You agree that LGE may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK, or any features
within the SDK to You or to users generally, at LGE’s sole discretion, without prior notice to You.

2.8 Nothing in this License Agreement gives You any right to use any of LGE’s trade names, trademarks,
service marks, logos, domain names or other distinctive brand features.

2.9 You agree that You shall not remove, obscure or alter any copyright, trademark or other
proprietary rights notices that may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.

personal and non-personal information of Users, You shall:

(b) Put in place a privacy policy that informs Users of the types of information that may be collected
and the purposes for which this information is collected and processed;
(c) Provide a mechanism for obtaining User consent to the collection and processing of their
information in accordance with the User’s privacy policy before the collection of any such information;

consents have been given;

(f) Put in place appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to secure and protect User
information; and
(g) Indemnify LGE against any claims, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, liabilities, damages, costs
and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to any breach by You of this
section 2.10.
2.11 Applications may be rejected if they contain content or materials of any kind(including, but not
limited to, text, graphics, images, photographs, sounds, etc.) that LGE reasonably determines to be
objectionable or inappropriate, for example, materials that may be considered obscene, pornographic
of defamatory.
2.12 You acknowledge and agree that the SDK is not designed, intended, or certified for use in
components of systems or Application intended for the operation of weapons, weapons systems, nuclear
installations, means of mass transportation, aviation, medical or life-support computers or equipment
(including resuscitation equipment and surgical implants), pollution control, hazardous substances
management, or for any other dangerous Application in which the failure of the SDK could create a
situation where personal injury or death may occur. You understand that use of the SDK in such
Applications is fully at Your risk.
2. 13 From time to time during the Term, LGE may provide You with test versions of the SDK. You
acknowledge and agree that You must not rely on such test versions to perform with data that is not
sufficiently backed up on a regular basis.

resources provided by a third party, You agree that LGE is not responsible for those applications,
data, content or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which You may access
through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person or entity from which
they originated and that LGE is not liable for any loss or damage that You may experience as a result
of the use of or access to any of those third party applications, data, content or resources. You
acknowledge that Your use of such third party applications, data, content or resources may be subject
to a separate agreement between You and the relevant third party. In such case, this License Agreement
shall not affect Your legal relationship with such third party(ies).

4.2 If the Application is distributed, licensed or otherwise offered under the white-labeling of a
third party, LGE may object to such distribution if LGE reasonably believes that the distribution of
the Application cause adverse effect on LGE’s business and upon such objection, You shall immediately
cease to distribute the Application and discuss in good faith to find an alternative which will be
beneficial to both Parties.

may be in an inconvenient forum. The award rendered by the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon
the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 15.1, in the event You infringe
upon or violate the intellectual property rights of LGE or breach any of Your confidentiality obligations

the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all oral and/or written agreements and understandings
between the Parties related to the subject matter hereof. If any provision hereof is held for any reason
